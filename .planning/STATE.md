# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-04)

**Core value:** `make cluster-up && make build && make load && make deploy` produces a running, reachable app on a local kind cluster — the full local build-to-deploy loop works end to end
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Scaffold + App + Tests

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Scaffold + App + Tests)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-04 — Roadmap created; 4 phases defined covering 21 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Coarse granularity (4 phases) — scaffold+app+tests grouped in Phase 1 to establish git hygiene before any scripts land
- Roadmap: CLUS-01/02 isolated in Phase 2 — cluster registry wiring is a hard prerequisite for image push; atomic in cluster-up
- Roadmap: MongoDB uses plain mongo:7 manifests embedded in chart (not Bitnami — paywalled since Aug 2025)
- Roadmap: Dockerfile uses gunicorn from first write — Flask dev server never appears in any Dockerfile CMD

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag (Phase 2): Verify registry wiring with a test image pull from within the cluster before proceeding to Phase 3
- Research flag (Phase 3): Test MongoDB auth connection string with `?authSource=admin` explicitly
- Research flag (Phase 3): Verify mongomock supports PyMongo 4.13.x API; fall back to monkeypatch if incompatible
